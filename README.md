DiscoverGists
=============

***DiscoverGists*** helps you (and the participants of WebGeneralisation) to discover your GitHub-Gists!

### Background:

* inspired by the original idea of Mike Bostock: [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/)

* uses GitHub-API to [request the gists](http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/)

* uses an browser-oriented API-wrapper: [Github.js](https://github.com/michael/github)
